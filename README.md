# Recreo

* Play dates are essential for kids to develop social and networking skills and more importantly everlasting friendships
* It often becomes incumbent on parents to arrange these play dates for their child
* It would be nice if there was a convenient, easy and trustworthy way to arrange play dates, and that is where Recreo would come in
