# Recreo

We've set out to build an easy and light-weight app that allows people to organize and manage events with friends and family, send invites, and keep track of event details and communication.

* Unlike organizing events on FB, where guests must have a FB account, on Recreo you can add anyone to an event with their phone number. If they don't have the app, they can still be part of the conversation by chatting over SMS.
